## [SiligongValley #Hacktoberfest 2019](https://www.meetup.com/SiligongValley/events/265486790/)

This year, SiligongValley is hosting a Hacktoberfest event where we will be able to bring together local developers of all levels to share in the community of open source.

Our agenda will cover:

* Welcome
Introduction to open source, #Hacktoberfest, and GitHub PRs
* Pitch your repos
A chance for anyone to share the open source projects they are working on and request help from the community
* Hack together
Spend some time looking at the issues in open source repositories
* Create PRs

What to bring:

* If you maintain, support or follow an open source code base, it would be great if you could bring along some simple issues which could be shared.
* If you're new to programming or open source, bring your questions and we can help get you started.
* Something to hack on.

Many thanks to Accelo who have have kindly offered their space for this event!
